<h1>Unit 8 - Mobile Apps Development</h1>

<p>In this unit was mainly about how to design, develop, test and review a mobile app. Skills obtained from other units can be used </p>

 <p>Understand the characteristics and uses of mobile apps.</p>
 <p>I had to review 2 different mobile apps then discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the app and how the features affects the usability of the app.</p>
  
<h3>Learning Aim: B</h3>

 <p> The task given to me was to design a alphabet app to help children aged 3-7 years old recognise the shapes and sounds of the alphabet. </p>
<h3>Learning Aim: C</h3>
 <p>Develop and test a mobile app.</p>
 <p>I had developed a few mobile app designs set as tasks, for practice and understanding. I also had to develop the alphabet app and documented changes made to the original design.</p>
<h3>Learning Aim: D</h3>
 <p>Review the finished mobile app.</p>
 <p>I had test and review the app, also justifying the changes/refinements made to the design.</p>
