<h1>Unit 14 - Installing and Maintaining Computer Hardware</h1>
<h3>Learning Aim: A</h3>
 <p> Understand the benefits and implications of installing and maintaining hardware in technolodgy systems.</p>
 <p>I had to do an investigation about the benefits and implications (possible issues) with installing and maintaining hardware.</p>
<h3>Learning Aim: B</h3>
 <p>Plan installation and maintenance of hardware in a technology system.</p>
 <p>I had to create a plan for installing 2 computer components as well as diagnosing and fixing faults within the system. </p>
<h3>Learning Aim: C</h3>
 <p>Installing, maintain and test hardware in a technology system.</p>
 <p>I had to follow the plan i created to install the 2 computer components, diagnose and fix the faults which were time not being kept on the system and the computer not booting up. 
    I also had to upgrade the RAM, install a PCIe USB 3.0 card and a graphics tablet to meet client requirments.</p>
<h3>Learning Aim: D</h3>
 <p>Review the modified technology system.</p>
 <p>After installing and maintaining the system I had to review the modified system to the original plan and justify any changes made. I also had to recommend further improvements and consider constraints I encountered. </p>
